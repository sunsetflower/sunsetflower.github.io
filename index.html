/p "HOCR (Head of the Charles Rigade) is a huge boat race that happens every year on the Charles River. It is three miles long, and hundreds of people come to watch it. 
Many clothing, espesicly for sports is sold in tents. There are also a couple tents with free samples of food, and many more with no samples which have food like apple 
crisp and hamburgers, also hotdogs and fried dough. All that food has trash build-up. This is a sticker that was handed out by two volenteers at HOCR. Thank you, 
volenteers! It is advertising recycling."
